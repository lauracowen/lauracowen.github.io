# Laura's postnatal reading recommendations

This is a collection of the various books and related resources that I've recommended at various times on the Winchester NCT WhatsApp chat. Rather than keep spamming everyone when a new mum or dad joins the group, I've created this page. 

## Background

My baby is about 1 year old at the time of writing and we're still breastfeeding alongside solids, which she is now eating fairly reliably (when she's not ill from vaccinations or colds...). She was born during the third lockdown when everything was still fairly shut. Winchester NCT Walk and Talk was a lifeline when no other activities could happen. Not least because the local breastfeeding counsellors took turns at joining the walks so that new mums could get feeding advice, as well as fresh air and company. 

When she was born, she latched and breastfed from the start but one side was always painful for me. After a couple of weeks, both sides were painful (she made a kind of chomping motion when feeding). It turned out that she had tongue tie but it wasn't the obvious kind (she could stick her tongue out and it wasn't heart-shaped) so no one spotted it. The NCT breastfeeding counsellors, who are great, suggested getting my health visitor to refer me for a tongue tie assessment as it wasn't improving. It took two attempts a month apart to get it released fully (at 4 months). Her feeding did improve then but she still has a shallow latch so it's continued to be uncomfortable most of the time. As she got older and started feeding less frequently, it got easier to tolerate; as my breastfeeding counsellor had advised, when I was no longer feeding every 1.5hrs during the day, it became less of a big deal in my life and was more tolerable.

Top tip: download the Kindle app or buy a Kindle with a backlight (or similar). I love a physical book on my shelf as much as the next person but physical books take two hands and can be heavy when dropped on your newborn's head. 

## Breastfeeding

[The Positive Breastfeeding Book: Everything you need to feed your baby with confidence](The Positive Breastfeeding Book: Everything you need to feed your baby with confidence https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07F1XT3NZ/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_30FH1892HREF43SKCG3C) 
This book contains all the information I found out the hard way (googling at 2am and reading endless Facebook threads) during the first three months postnatal. I think every pregnant woman should read this so you have some idea what to expect and where to get help of you need it. Antenatal classes are not sufficient.
As well as the early days, it discusses how the breastfeed and go back to work.

If breastfeeding goes smoothly for you, that's all you should need. 

If, however, you hit problems, especially in the early days, here are a couple of short books I found useful. 

[Why Tongue-tie Matters (Pinter & Martin book by Sarah Oakley)] (Why Tongue-tie Matters https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08VX3CB3K) 
Reviews the research on tongue tie. You don't need to read this even if your baby has tongue tie and just gets it released (cut), but it's an easy-read of you want to understand more.
One thing I don't recommend (though obviously it's up to you!) is the mention of "bodywork" and osteopaths. As far as I can tell, there's no evidence that it can help improve breastfeeding (I keep meaning to email the author to check this but none is mentioned, in the book, which I think is bad form because you almost don't realise when the rest of the book is about reviewing the evidence). 
I believe the woman who did masses of work to improve understanding of tongue tie is now endorsing "bodywork" alongside tongue tie releasing (cutting). So it seems to be recommended by lactation consultants etc as if it's an evidenced treatment but I don't think it is. The [NHS lists the scope of evidence for osteopathy]( https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteopathy/) and doesn't mention breastfeeding or babies at all. 
My personal opinion is that, without evidence that it actually works, it's a way to make money from desperate parents who will pay money for anything if they think it might help. Trust me, that's a real feeling. 

[Why Breastfeeding Grief and Trauma Matter (Pinter & Martin book by Amy Brown)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B081S2X6BN) 
Again, this is only for reading if breastfeeding doesn't work out the way you expected. Breastfeeding is natural like walking or talking, but like walking and talking requires you to learn new skills and to practise. I promise it's worth persisting if you can. 
The author is same as The Positive Breastfeeding Book - she's really readable; I'm a big fan of her writing.



## Starting solid foods

We went the "baby-led weaning" route (i.e. finger foods from the start, no purees, hardly any spoonfeeding by us). The resources below are all relevant whichever route you take though. Biggest thing we learnt: being patient, keep offering variety, and trusting our baby to know what she needs (easy to say, hard to do in the moment, but it was true). 

Mini First Aid course. 

[Why Starting Solids Matters (Pinter & Martin Why it Matters Book 10 by Amy Brown](https://amzn.eu/dlhsEdi) 
This is a short book that reviews the research evidence around starting solids. I found it useful for nutritional info among other things. Some things I learnt: why you should wait until 6 months and why there's usually no point starting solids earlier; that while there's no yet much research into baby-led weaning (as a method), there's also no evidence to support traditional puree spoonfeeding; babies innately know how much food they need, unless you override that instinct and then it's gone for good; important thing is to be responsive to baby's needs. I've read a few of those short books in that Why... Matters series - they're really good and easy to read.

[What Mummy Makes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Mummy-Makes-Cook-just/dp/0241455154) 
A recipe book for meals and finger foods that are suitable from 6 months. Doesn't include purees but the author did herself start with purees so she's not anti-puree. 

She's on Instagram too.
