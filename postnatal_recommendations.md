# Laura's postnatal reading recommendations

This is a collection of the various books and related resources that I've recommended at various times on the Winchester NCT WhatsApp chat. Rather than keep spamming everyone when a new mum or dad joins the group, I've created this page. All recommendations are just based on my own experience as Mum of one baby; I'm not a professional at any of this.

My book links are to Amazon purely because I bought most of them on Kindle (one-handed with backlight rocks; I haven't read a physical book since my baby was born).

## Breastfeeding

Antenatal classes don't (for whatever reason) properly prepare you for breastfeeding (or for combi-feeding or even really formula feeding). Rather than spending the first three months like me, Googling and reading endless Facebook threads, just read one book (ideally before the birth):

- [The Positive Breastfeeding Book: Everything you need to feed your baby with confidence](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07F1XT3NZ/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_30FH1892HREF43SKCG3C) (book)
 
  This book contains most of the information I found out the hard way. I think every pregnant woman should read this, so you have some idea what to expect and where to get help of you need it. It's also useful later on in your breastfeeding journey; eg returning to work.

If breastfeeding goes smoothly for you, that's all you should need.

### Breastfeeding problems

However, if you hit problems, especially in the early days, here are a couple of short books I found useful (we had undiagnosed tongue tie which caused pain and a lot of stress in the first few months):

- [Why Tongue-tie Matters (Pinter & Martin book by Sarah Oakley)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08VX3CB3K) (book)

  Reviews the research on tongue tie. Even if your baby has tongue tie, you don't need to read this, but it's an easy read if you want to understand more.

   One thing I don't recommend (though obviously it's your call!) is the mention of "bodywork" and osteopaths. As far as I can tell, there's no evidence that it can help improve breastfeeding (I keep meaning to email the author to check this but there are no citations for her assertions about "bodywork" in the book, which you almost don't notice when the rest of the book is about reviewing the evidence). My personal opinion is that, without evidence that it actually works, it's just a way to make money from desperate parents who will pay money for anything if they think it might help (here's [what the NHS says about the evidence for osteopathy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteopathy/)).

- [Why Breastfeeding Grief and Trauma Matter (Pinter & Martin book by Amy Brown)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B081S2X6BN) (book)

   Again, this is only for reading if breastfeeding hasn't worked out the way you expected. The author is same as The Positive Breastfeeding Book - she's really readable; I'm a big fan of her writing.

- [Breastfeeding and Lactation Support UK](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1346569932113892) (Facebook group)

   I learnt a lot from just browsing and reading the threads and links that other people had posted. Though it'd have been quicker if I'd just found and read The Positive Breastfeeding Book instead in the first place.

## Starting solid foods

We went the "baby-led weaning" route (i.e. finger foods from the start, no purees, hardly any spoonfeeding). However, the following resources are all relevant whichever route you take:

- [Why Starting Solids Matters (Pinter & Martin Why it Matters Book 10 by Amy Brown](https://amzn.eu/dlhsEdi) (book)

   A short book that reviews the research evidence around starting solids. I found it useful for nutritional info among other things but very informative about various aspects of weaning (one-sentence summary: be responsive to baby's needs and don't feel pressured to start early).

   I've read a few of those short books in that Why... Matters series - they're really good and easy to read.

- [What Mummy Makes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Mummy-Makes-Cook-just/dp/0241455154) (book)

   A recipe book for family meals and finger foods that are suitable from 6 months. Some really useful things (like salt-free, skinless sausages; tuna chickpea pasties; chocolate ice cream) you can cook in batch and freeze. She basically takes a single set of ingredients and almost every recipe uses a subset of them so you're not constantly finding you need to buy something else.

- [Mini First Aid course](https://www.minifirstaid.co.uk/) (course; we did it on Zoom but may now be available in-person)

   Really clear and practical course on first aid for babies and toddlers. We did it through Basingstoke NCT on Zoom during lockdown (or near-lockdown). It's very good, even without being able to do hands-on practice (though I think it probably goes in better if you get some hands-on practice during the class). She also sells first aid kits, which we bought as they contain the stuff you need.
   
 - [Solid Starts](https://www.instagram.com/solidstarts/) (Instagram)

   Run by paediatric feeding experts. Posts useful and reassuring information about giving real food to babies. But don't be intimidated by some of their videos of ~8 mth old babies eating loads of food and not just throwing it on the floor. They're nice inspiring videos but if your baby doesn't do that (mine didn't until past 12 months) don't be put off.

## Babywearing (slings)

I would now never buy a sling without having tried it out first. I had a sling consultation (on Zoom) then hired a sling for four weeks. My baby and I got a lot more confident but we were close to six months and didn't think the newborn one would last long. So we hired another one for a week. We both loved it the first time we tried it so I bought one.

- [Caroline, Sling Consultant at Bourne Green](https://www.bournegreen.co.uk/hire) (was Seaside Parenting; sling consultations on Zoom or in Bournemouth.

   Caroline was really helpful. After paying for a consultation, she provides free on-going support on Facebook Messenger; eg you can post photos of your sling wearing and she can give you feedback.
