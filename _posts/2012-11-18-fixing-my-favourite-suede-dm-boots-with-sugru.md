I have some lovely burgundy suede, knee-high Doc Martens boots that I&#8217;ve had for a few years. They are incredibly comfy and I&#8217;ve worn them a lot. Here they are:

The problem is that while the soles of the boots are tough and pretty durable in the usual DM way, they&#8217;re really thin and where the suede overhangs slightly at the heel, the suede has worn through. Like this:

That&#8217;s the left one. The right one isn&#8217;t quite so bad:

It seemed like a good opportunity to finally try <a title="Sugru website" href="https://sugru.com/" target="_blank">Sugru</a>. I needed black Sugru so I bought a pack of black and white (4 5g packets of each). Having never used it before, it was hard to know how much I&#8217;d need but each 5g packet goes surprisingly far.

Sugru comes as soft, coloured putty which you mould to shape and then leave to cure into a hard rubber finish at room temperature. I&#8217;d expected it to be a bit of a rush to get the shape right before it started to cure but it actually wasn&#8217;t a problem. You have about 20 minutes to work before it starts to cure and that was plenty.

### Session 1: Fixing the holes

Although I&#8217;d originally planned to stitch the suede to create a base for the Sugru, in the end I just filled the holes with Sugru and pressed the edges of the damaged suede into it. This created a nice solid base, took me only about 10 minutes, and used less then one packet altogether.

The left boot:

And the right boot:

It was a bit rough-looking at this stage but it didn&#8217;t matter because there&#8217;d be more going on later. I checked that it didn&#8217;t cause any lumpiness inside and then left it to cure, which takes about 24 hours, though I left it for longer.

I used the leftovers from the packet to fix the zip. Originally, the boots each had a zip toggle like this:

But one of them had pulled off at some point, so I made a new one, like this:

(Not massively neat but it&#8217;s on the inside of the leg, mostly out of sight, so it&#8217;s fine.)

### Session 2: Extending the sole over the heel

In the second session, I extended the existing sole of each boot up the back of the suede heel. This covered up the damage and will, hopefully, protect the heel better in future:

This took two 5g sachets of Sugru and maybe 15-20 minutes to complete but the Sugru stayed soft enough for me to finish smoothing and shaping for as long as I needed.

Since finishing them, I&#8217;ve worn them twice and they seem to be coping well. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d notice that the heel wasn&#8217;t original (now that the Sugru is as grubby as the rest):
