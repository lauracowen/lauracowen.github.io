I have some lovely burgundy suede, knee-high Doc Martens boots that I&#8217;ve had for a few years. They are incredibly comfy and I&#8217;ve worn them a lot. Here they are:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2044" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1017-cropped-271x300.jpg" alt="IMG_1017-cropped" width="271" height="300" srcset="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1017-cropped-271x300.jpg 271w, http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1017-cropped.jpg 542w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" />](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1017-cropped.jpg)

The problem is that while the soles of the boots are tough and pretty durable in the usual DM way, they&#8217;re really thin and where the suede overhangs slightly at the heel, the suede has worn through. Like this: [<img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1408" title="IMG_0982-cropped" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0982-cropped-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0982-cropped.jpg) That&#8217;s the left one. The right one isn&#8217;t quite so bad: [<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2050" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0986-cropped-300x185.jpg" alt="IMG_0986-cropped" width="300" height="185" srcset="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0986-cropped-300x185.jpg 300w, http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0986-cropped.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0986-cropped1.jpg) It seemed like a good opportunity to finally try <a title="Sugru website" href="https://sugru.com/" target="_blank">Sugru</a>. I needed black Sugru so I bought a pack of black and white (4 5g packets of each). Having never used it before, it was hard to know how much I&#8217;d need but each 5g packet goes surprisingly far.

Sugru comes as soft, coloured putty which you mould to shape and then leave to cure into a hard rubber finish at room temperature. I&#8217;d expected it to be a bit of a rush to get the shape right before it started to cure but it actually wasn&#8217;t a problem. You have about 20 minutes to work before it starts to cure and that was plenty.

### Session 1: Fixing the holes

Although I&#8217;d originally planned to stitch the suede to create a base for the Sugru, in the end I just filled the holes with Sugru and pressed the edges of the damaged suede into it. This created a nice solid base, took me only about 10 minutes, and used less then one packet altogether.

The left boot:

[<img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1412" title="IMG_0988-cropped" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0988-cropped-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0988-cropped.jpg) And the right boot: [<img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1413" title="IMG_0992-cropped" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0992-cropped-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0992-cropped.jpg) It was a bit rough-looking at this stage but it didn&#8217;t matter because there&#8217;d be more going on later. I checked that it didn&#8217;t cause any lumpiness inside and then left it to cure, which takes about 24 hours, though I left it for longer.

I used the leftovers from the packet to fix the zip. Originally, the boots each had a zip toggle like this:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1414" title="IMG_0995-cropped" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0995-cropped-162x300.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="300" />](http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0995-cropped.jpg)

But one of them had pulled off at some point, so I made a new one, like this: [<img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1415" title="IMG_0997-cropped" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0997-cropped-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0997-cropped.jpg) (Not massively neat but it&#8217;s on the inside of the leg, mostly out of sight, so it&#8217;s fine.)

### Session 2: Extending the sole over the heel

In the second session, I extended the existing sole of each boot up the back of the suede heel. This covered up the damage and will, hopefully, protect the heel better in future:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1416" title="IMG_1013-cropped" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1013-cropped-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" />](http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1013-cropped.jpg) This took two 5g sachets of Sugru and maybe 15-20 minutes to complete but the Sugru stayed soft enough for me to finish smoothing and shaping for as long as I needed.

Since finishing them, I&#8217;ve worn them twice and they seem to be coping well. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d notice that the heel wasn&#8217;t original (now that the Sugru is as grubby as the rest):
