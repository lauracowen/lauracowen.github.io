Last year, after getting a Nintendo Wii, I wrote <a title="Nintendo Wii power consumption post" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2008/07/04/wii-power-consumption/" target="_self">a post about its energy consumption</a> and Nintendo&#8217;s place in Greenpeace&#8217;s electronics company rankings.

Greenpeace have updated their rankings&#8230;and <a title="Greenpeace ranked list of electronics companies" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up" target="_blank">Nintendo still holds bottom place</a>. Pleased to see that Samsung and Nokia are still doing well (I have a Nokia phone and Samsung laptop and TV &#8211; part of my reason for going with Samsung was their green and ethical reputation).
