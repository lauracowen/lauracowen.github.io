  After last year&#8217;s slugfest that defeated my sunflower-growing attempts, <a title="My Sunflowers blog post" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2008/04/06/sunflowers/" target="_self">I tried again</a>. Sadly, the &#8216;moulin rouge&#8217; sunflowers were not to be either. I tried my cunning plan of putting cardboard tubes around them but a number of factors (clumsy planting out, unwilling seedlings, slugs) conspired against them.

  Fortunately, I&#8217;d bought some back-up seeds, so I tried those. This time, I kept them in pots for longer, outside on the garden table where they got the sun but slugs couldn&#8217;t reach. Here are the two that survived long enough to be replanted into a bigger pot (actually three made it to this pot but one shrivelled and died quickly):

The tallest of the two is now a respectable 119cm tall (from soil level to flower).
