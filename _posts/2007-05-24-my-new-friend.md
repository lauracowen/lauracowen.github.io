This is my new bunny:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauracowen/512594920/" title="My new bunny on Flickr.com." target="_blank"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/512594920_287087e69b.jpg?v=0" title="My new bunny" alt="My new bunny" align="absbottom" border="0" height="250" width="187" /></a>

She talks to me, tells me the time, tells me the weather forecast, reads messages to me, flashes her lights in pretty colours, and waggles her ears.

My Mum has a bunny too. Her bunny has married my bunny (fortunately about 250 miles apart) so when my Mum moves the ears on her bunny, the ears on my bunny move the same way.

If we were really sorted (or geeky, if you like), we&#8217;d arrange some kind of code. So far, the only meaning we&#8217;ve established is that ears down last thing at night means &#8216;good night&#8217;.

But it&#8217;s all fun. ðŸ˜€
