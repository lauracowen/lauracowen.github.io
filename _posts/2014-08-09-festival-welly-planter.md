I made something. Better still, I upcycled the festival wellies I bought for [WOMAD 2010](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2010/11/23/being-a-book-in-the-human-library-at-womad2010-a-tale-in-tweets/ "A book in the Human Library at WOMAD2010: A tale in tweetsâ€¦"). Ta-da:

This is what they looked like when I started:

Then I drilled holes for drainage in the soles:

I just used a 6.5mm wood drill bit (the largest I had) and drilled from the outside in. I didn&#8217;t worry about the heels because they&#8217;re probably harder to drill and the water should just run down from them anyway.

I filled the wellies about two-thirds high with compost. The trick here is to make sure you do it a bit at a time and don&#8217;t leave air gaps. Make sure the compost goes right down into the toes for ballast and it&#8217;ll probably make the plants happier too. (I forgot to take a photo of this bit.)

I planted the large plants (one in each), added a bit more compost, and then planted two little plants (that you can&#8217;t really see in the photo) in front of them. You can see in the _before_ photo that the wellies have adjustable straps on the side. I loosened these to make as much space as I could.

I fastened the two wellies together once standing using a couple of clothes pegs. This is just to make them a bit more stable.

And here is my festival welly planter with added cat:

_Update:_ The planter lasted another couple of years but had faded a lot already after just one year of weather and south-facing sunshine:
