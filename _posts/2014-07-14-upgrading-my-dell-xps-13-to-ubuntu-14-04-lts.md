Meanwhile, Germany had won the Men&#8217;s World Cup for the first time since reunification (but their fourth if you count West Germany&#8217;s wins), the first European team to win in South America:

I decided to reinstall from scratch. I should probably have done this in the first place because the original installation was the one Dell did with all their custom packages to make the hardware work. The Dell XPS 13 packages (for the laptop I bought in July 2013 anyway) are now all in the official Ubuntu repositories. I think my problems were probably caused by clashes of some kind between the old and new packages.

Almost all my data files are backed up in Dropbox so that bit&#8217;s easy. The Windows 7 virtual machine I use for PhD software is about 26 GB but I can rebuild it if the HDD dies, so I don&#8217;t bother backing it up (the data on it goes into Dropbox). I figured, however, that backing it up to my USB stick might be useful and save me some time. Annoyingly, that&#8217;s the bit that took most of the time. Downloading the Ubuntu ISO and creating a USB installation disk took no time. Then installing it was pretty quick too.

It&#8217;s doubly annoying that the virtual machine took so much of the time (I finished about 1.30am, leaving Dropbox doing its thing while I slept). After waiting for the files to copy back to my newly-installed laptop this morning, I discovered that I&#8217;ve been working in a VirtualBox snapshot. So the 13 GB Snapshots folder that I&#8217;d not copied was kindof essential to things and the virtual machine wouldn&#8217;t boot without it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck">
  <p>
    Oh well, so much for backing up my VM. Forgot I was using the snapshot I didn't copy with it. üôÅ Now rebuilding afterall&#8230;

I can&#8217;t find my Nvivo 10 CD either but I imagine installing Windows 7 and its updates will take most of today anyway. Fortunately it&#8217;s sunny so I might just leave it installing and go do (PhD) reading in the garden.
