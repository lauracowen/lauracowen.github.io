I picked up my final piece of pottery course work tonight. Formally known as &#8216;Unit 03 final piece&#8217;, here are the best of my mugs:

![Mugs](http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/20032008001-small.jpg) 

Unfortunately, I have ended up with fewer working mugs than people who have hinted they&#8217;d like one. And I definitely owe my parents some pottery to clutter up their house after [I kept the sunflower planter](http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2008/02/11/four-months-in-the-making-ormy-pottery-project/ "Four Months in the Making (orâ€¦My Pottery Project) post") (a.k.a. &#8216;Unit 02&#8217;).

So my apologies in public (that way you have to smile and say you don&#8217;t mind):

&#8220;Sorry to everyone who I&#8217;d like to have presented with a mug. If I do the course again next year, you will, of course, be foremost in my mind.&#8221;

And with that, my pottery course 2007-2008 is over. I&#8217;ve decided not to carry on next term because I&#8217;ve signed up to learn pole-dancing again. More on that later&#8230;.
