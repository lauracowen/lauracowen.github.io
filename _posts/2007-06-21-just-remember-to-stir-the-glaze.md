Tonight, I picked up this term&#8217;s output from my pottery class. Since Easter, I made two mugs and a vase (all centred by myself &#8211; the bit where the clay flies off the wheel if you don&#8217;t do it properly), a kind of squashed bowl (not centred myself), and a hand-moulded (thumbpot) candle holder for the garden.  
[<img title="Tea caddy" src="http://gallery.tonywhitmore.co.uk/d/5372-2/IMG_1433.jpg" border="0" alt="Tea caddy" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="135" height="150" align="left" />](http://gallery.tonywhitmore.co.uk/d/5372-2/IMG_1433.jpg "Tea caddy")

Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t stir the glaze well enough so the colour is rather washed out. And the mugs don&#8217;t quite match the tea caddy that I made last term.

The tea caddy is probably the best finished piece so far but the mugs are my best achievement.

I&#8217;ve signed up for more classes in September.
